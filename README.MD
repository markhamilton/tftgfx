I'm going to have some classic demoscene stuff in here. For now, it's a rotating cube.


The challenge
--
Render classic demoscenes with an arduino and seeedstudio TFT touch display.



What I have

- Rotating 3D cube



What I want
--

 - Mandelbrot + Julia fractals
 - Game of life
 - Plasma
 - Some really basic ray tracing stuff with random geometry
 - Cityscape renderer
 - Particles with physics and attractors
 - Fancy text
 - Landscape renderer
 - Wireframe flythroughs
 - 3D Star field
 - 3D rotating shapes (letters, x-hedrons) in a faux-3D background
